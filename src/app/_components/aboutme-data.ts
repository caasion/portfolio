`Welcome to my life operating system, BunOS.

I love bunnies, startups, tech, and neuroscience. I love to explore the intersection of brains and machines. I'm obsessed with efficiency, which drove me to building technology that optimizes complex systems in the real world (i.e. the slow airplane boarding process).

I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I execute and learn fast. I learned that as an important trait from building in Waterloo.`;
